Welcome to the final project of the SE factory FCS course. 
Here we are designing a social media network called:

A program featuring a menu with 12 choices 
offers an exceptional level of ease of use, ensuring 
users can effortlessly navigate through a comprehensive range 
of options. This well-organized menu structure allows users to quickly
find and select the desired function, reducing the time spent searching for 
specific features. Each choice is clearly labeled and logically arranged, making 
the user interface intuitive even for those with limited technical experience. 



1. Add user:

   Create a new user profile in the social network. You will be prompted to enter a unique user ID and        other relevant information such as name and contact details.

2. Add friend:

   Establish a friendship connection between two users. You will need to specify the user IDs of both     
   individuals to create a mutual link in the network.

3. Remove friend:

   Delete an existing friendship connection between two users. Enter the user IDs of the two individuals      to sever their link in the network.


4. Update your bio:

   Edit and update the biography or personal information of a user. You will be prompted to enter the user    ID and the new bio details.

5. Delete user:

   Permanently remove a user and all their connections from the social network. This action requires the      user ID of the account to be deleted.

6. Calculate network statistics:

    Compute and display various statistics about the social network, such as the number of users, average      number of friends per user, and other relevant metrics.

7. Binary search a user:

    Perform a binary search to find a user based on their user ID. This function helps quickly locate a        user within a sorted list of IDs.

8. Recommend a friend:

    Suggest potential friends for a user based on mutual connections and network algorithms. Enter the         user ID to receive friend recommendations.

9. Use BFS algorithm:

    Execute a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the network. This is useful for exploring       the network layer by layer.

10. Use DFS algorithm:

    Execute a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the network. This method explores as far as       possible along each branch before backtracking, useful for tasks like finding all connected components.

11. Dijkastras algorithm:

    Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two users in the network. This is    
    particularly useful for weighted graphs where paths have different costs or distances.

12. Exit:

    Terminate the program. This option allows users to safely exit the application and ensures all data is     properly closed before quitting.
